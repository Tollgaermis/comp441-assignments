# Assignment 2: Convolutional Neural Networks
**Due on November 20, 2023 (23:59:59)**

Hi again!

In the Assignment 2, you will delve into the intricacies of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, you will acquire practical knowledge of how to train these networks, grasp the nuances of their structure, and get to know how to apply transfer learning within the context of deep learning architectures..

During your assignment, please follow the instructions in the provided jupyter notebook carefully.

# Set-up
In the previous assignment, we've showed you how to create your environment. This time, we expect you to create your own environment with the required libraries (torch, PIL, tqdm, etc.).

# Bouns Part
In that part, you can get extra credits for your assignment. You will use [Utku Ozbulakâ€™s PyTorch CNN Visualizations Library](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations/) to visualize the important parts of the input image for a particular output class. In particular, just select a specific picture of an actor, and then using your trained network in Part 2.4, perform Gradient visualization with guided backpropagation to understand the prediction for that actor with respect to the input image. Comment on your results.
